        <h1>Case Study: Avatar-Based Social Media Platform</h1>
        <p>
          This project was a prototype and research-based initiative designed to help us understand the preparation and planning necessary before coding. The goal was to create an interactive prototype app proposed to a clientâ€”in our case, our teachers and classmates.

        <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
        <p>
          A new, innovative social media platform that differs from traditional platforms. This avatar-based social media experience moves beyond endless scrolling, allowing users to interact in a more dynamic and immersive way.

        <h2>Approach & Methodology</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Inspired by classic interactive experiences like Club Penguin, users can navigate a virtual world with avatars.</li>
          <li>Users can walk around their city, meet new people, and engage with content in an innovative way.</li>
          <li>Standard social media features like posting and scrolling remain integrated.</li>
          <li>Prototyping was completed using Figma to create an interactive visual representation of the app.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Execution & Implementation</h2>
        <p>
          The project followed a structured Agile approach with iterative sprints ensuring continuous feedback and adaptability. We used Trello to track progress and ensure alignment within the team.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Conducted interviews and market research to define scope and objectives.</li>
          <li>Developed an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) to test core functionalities.</li>
          <li>Implemented unit, integration, A/B, and user acceptance testing.</li>
          <li>Rolled out in phases to minimize disruption.</li>
          <li>Collected feedback and made necessary refinements.</li>
        </ul>
